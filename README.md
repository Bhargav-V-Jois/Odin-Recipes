# Odin-Recipes:
Repository for The Odin Project's Odin-Recipes project.

## Languages Used:
HTML.
CSS.
Javascript.

## Goal:
In this project I created an app that fetches data from <a href="spoonacular.com">Spoonacular</a> API and list it.

## Note:
I know that my API key is exposed in the app.js due to what I am doing is VanillaJS hence it is completely client side hence can not use Environmental Variables.
